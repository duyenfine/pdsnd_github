### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project utilizes Python, NumPy and pandas to explore trends of the bike share systems in three major cities: Chicago, NYC, and Washington DC in an interactive environment. User will be able to filter the raw data city, month and day of the week. After that, they can determine how many lines of raw data they want to view. Consequentially, descriptive statistics of most popular month, day, hour (based on user's preference), start station, end station, trip duration, user type, gender, and birth year for user's selected portion of the data will be displayed. In the end, user can choose to continue exploring other portions of the data or exit the program.
